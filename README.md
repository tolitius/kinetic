... and some love

```clojure
$ make repl

=> (require '[kinetic.consumer :as k])
```

## consumer

```clojure

=> (def consumer
     (k/start-consumer {:stream-name "lagoon-nebula"
                        :application-name "hubble"
                        :consume k/echo}))
```

[echo](https://github.com/tolitius/kinetic/blob/2cdde9a3ca55ec3f2b6a2a4aaa1b6924f454d7f8/src/kinetic/consumer.clj#L190-L198) :point_up_2:
here is a sample function that decodes (UTF-8) and echos all the records it consumes from a kinesis stream

in order to do something more useful provide a function as a value of the "`:consume`" key<br/>
that takes a batch of kinesis records in [this format](https://github.com/tolitius/kinetic/blob/2cdde9a3ca55ec3f2b6a2a4aaa1b6924f454d7f8/src/kinetic/consumer.clj#L85-L94).

### initial position

by default a kinesis consumer will start consuming records from a previously recorded "`checkpoint`" that is stored in something that is called a "`lease`".

in order to start consuming from a custom place in a stream use a `:start-from` key:

```clojure
=> (def consumer
     (k/start-consumer {:stream-name "lagoon-nebula"
                        :application-name "hubble"
                        :start-from {:position :trim-horizon}
                        :consume k/echo}))
```

you would see this new "initial position" in logs when the shard is initialized:

```java
[ShardRecordProcessor-0000] INFO  kinetic.consumer - initializing shard shardId-000000000000 at sequence {SequenceNumber: TRIM_HORIZON,SubsequenceNumber: 0}
```

possible values are (as [per amazon's api](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/blob/0c5042dadf794fe988438436252a5a8fe70b6b0b/amazon-kinesis-client/src/main/java/software/amazon/kinesis/common/InitialPositionInStreamExtended.java#L36-L39)):

* `{:position :trim-horizon}`: start at the earliest sequence number available for your application
* `{:position :latest}`: start at the latest sequence number available on the stream
* `{:position :at-timestamp :timestamp <date>}`: start at a certain timestamp. the timestamp value is `java.util.Date`

for example:

```clojure
=> (import '[java.util Date]
           '[java.time Instant]
           '[java.time.temporal ChronoUnit])

=> (def yesterday                             ;; to start consuming from
     (-> (Instant/now)
         (.minus 1 ChronoUnit/DAYS)
         (Date/from)))

=> (def consumer
     (k/start-consumer {:stream-name "lagoon-nebula"
                        :application-name "hubble"
                        :start-from {:position :at-timestamp :timestamp yesterday}
                        :consume k/echo}))
```

you'll see a different starting sequence number in the logs:

```java
[ShardRecordProcessor-0000] INFO  kinetic.consumer - initializing shard shardId-000000000000 at sequence {SequenceNumber: AT_TIMESTAMP,SubsequenceNumber: 0}
```

and the records will start arriving from yesterday until the latest one on the stream.

### leases

```clojure
=> (k/show-leases consumer)

;; [#object[software.amazon.kinesis.leases.Lease 0x764d54a0
;; "Lease(leaseKey=shardId-000000000000,
;;        leaseOwner=d498fa4c-12b5-45b3-a82f-9025e396f952,
;;        leaseCounter=124,
;;        concurrencyToken=null,
;;        lastCounterIncrementNanos=null,
;;        checkpoint={SequenceNumber: 50638743107472231712790482650536060104711379819100635138,
;;                    SubsequenceNumber: 0},
;;        pendingCheckpoint=null,
;;        pendingCheckpointState=null,
;;        isMarkedForLeaseSteal=false,
;;        ownerSwitchesSinceCheckpoint=0,
;;        parentShardIds=[],
;;        childShardIds=[],
;;        hashKeyRangeForLease=HashKeyRangeForLease(startingHashKey=0,
;;                                                  endingHashKey=340282366920938463463374607431768211455))"]]
```

### stopping consumer

```clojure
=> (k/stop-consumer consumer))
```

### credentials

AWS credentials will be either picked up via the [regular AWS means](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials-chain.html)<br/>
or can be explicitly provided to kinetic consumer:

```clojure
(start-consumer {:stream-name "lagoon-nebula"
                 :application-name "hubble"
                 :start-from {:position :trim-horizon}
                 :creds {:access-key-id     "AK..ZZ"          ;; <= via a "creds" map
                         :secret-access-key "z0.........0m"}
                 :consume echo})
```
